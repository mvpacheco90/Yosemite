Volume estimations of rock-avalanche deposits are typically based on the deposit's surface expression. Old rock avalanche deposits located close to a source of sediments may, however, be partly covered. In such a situation, as we show, a combination of two geophysical methods - electrical resistivity tomography and ground penetrating radar - can image the basal contact of the rock avalanche and greatly improve its volume estimation. We applied this approach to the oldest preserved rock avalanche deposit in Yosemite Valley: The Royal Arches Meadow rock avalanche. Using 10Be exposure age dating, we showed that this rock avalanche occurred 16000 years ago. From our geophysical imaging of the basal contact, we discovered that a classical volume assessment underestimated the volume of this deposit by a factor of 3. The depth to the basal contact additionally allowed us to infer the regional cumulative aggradation since the last glacial maximum. Our work hence informs studies of the sedimentation history of Yosemite Valley and provides a geophysical strategy for researchers studying rock avalanche deposits world wide.
